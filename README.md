## Introduction

This project implements a sign language recognition system using machine learning techniques. It serves as an educational exercise to understand the process of building and training models for gesture recognition.

---

## Inspiration

This project is entirely based on the YouTube tutorial [Sign language detection with Python and Scikit Learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJCSjXepaAM&t=1103s) by **Nicholas Renotte**. The tutorial provided comprehensive guidance on developing the system, including data collection, model training, and evaluation.

---

## Features

- **Data Collection:** Utilizes webcam input to collect gesture data.
- **Model Training:** Implements machine learning algorithms for gesture classification.
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Recognizes and displays gestures in real-time.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Advaithdp02/Sign_Language_Recognition_ML.git
